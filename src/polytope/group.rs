/// If all of our matrices had integer entries, which is the case for a lot of
/// Coxeter groups, we could instead use a `HashSet` to reduce the complexity
/// to O(*n* log(*n*)). For floating point entries, where we'll rather want to
/// find the "closest" element to another one (to account for imprecision), a
